notes: >
  This version of GrimoireLab generally improves
  the performance of the identities manager. Now,
  individuals data will be loaded in the user
  interface much faster; recommendations will be
  generated for those identities updated after
  a giving date only, and the users will be able
  to add individuals to the workspace from the
  individual profile page.

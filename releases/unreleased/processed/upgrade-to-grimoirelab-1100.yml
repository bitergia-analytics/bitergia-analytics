issue: null
notes: >
  Sortinghat now shows usernames and emails in recommendations for
  easier comparison, includes clearer action labels, and security
  session cookies has a 30-minute inactivity timeout. New icons
  have been added for some datasources, and a bug with affiliation
  order has been fixed.

  Perceval now support Python 3.13 and raises an exception when using
  NNTP on Python > 3.13 due to nntplib removal.

  See GrimoireLab release notes for more information.

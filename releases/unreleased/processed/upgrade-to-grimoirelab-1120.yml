  GrimoireLab 1.12.0 fixes an issue with GitHub incremental collection
  that was not working correctly. It also resolves a SortingHat issue
  where, in some cases, the affiliation dates shown in the UI differed
  from those entered in the edit form. This release adds features like
  the ability to link a user's LinkedIn profile using the full URL.
  See the GrimoireLab release notes for full details.

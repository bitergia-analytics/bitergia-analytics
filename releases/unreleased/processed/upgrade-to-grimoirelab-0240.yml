notes: >
  GrimorieLab 0.24.0 includes a new version of Perceval
  that allows to recover commits in the case the
  process failed while fetching using the `--last-items`
  option.
  This new version also completes the migration of
  SortingHat to Vue 3 and fixes some errors related
  with its cache.
